1) Are luminosity and temperature related?

The evidence shows that the two have a correlation.
	The three days with lower temperature averages are days 19, 20, and 21.
	The corresponding luminosity averages are 41.8, 0.8, and 1.3.

Thus, we see that as the temperature decreased the luminosity also tended to decrease.
